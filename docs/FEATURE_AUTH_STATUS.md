# Feature-Based Authorization Implementation Status

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Core Authorization System
- ✅ Created `/src/config/featureAuth.ts` with pattern-based route-to-feature mapping
- ✅ Created `/src/utils/check-session-feature.ts` for simplified session checking
- ✅ Created `/src/hooks/useFeatureAccess.tsx` with React hooks for UI control
- ✅ Created comprehensive migration guide in `FEATURE_AUTH_MIGRATION.md`

### 2. Initial Page Migrations
- ✅ Updated `/src/pages/platform-settings.astro` to use new authorization
- ✅ Updated `/src/pages/dashboard.astro` to use new authorization
- ✅ Build successful - no breaking changes

### 3. System Architecture
- ✅ Unified frontend authorization with backend API structure
- ✅ Eliminated redundant route arrays (FeatureRoutes)
- ✅ Pattern-based feature detection using RegExp
- ✅ Platform admin gets all features automatically
- ✅ Cumulative role hierarchy support

## 🔄 Migration Progress

### Pages Updated (2/20)
- ✅ platform-settings.astro
- ✅ dashboard.astro

### Pages Remaining (18)
- ⏳ organizations/schemas/index.astro
- ⏳ organizations/credentials/issue/index.astro  
- ⏳ organizations/verification/index.astro
- ⏳ organizations/users/index.astro
- ⏳ connections.astro
- ⏳ invitations.astro
- ⏳ profile.astro
- ⏳ setting/index.astro
- ⏳ credentials/dashboard.astro
- ⏳ credentials/invitations.astro
- ⏳ credentials/index.astro
- ⏳ credentials/users.astro
- ⏳ organizations/credentials/issue/connections/issuance.astro
- ⏳ All verification sub-pages
- ⏳ All credential issue sub-pages
- ⏳ Other nested routes

## 🎯 Next Steps (Priority Order)

### High Priority
1. **Update Core Organization Pages**
   - schemas/index.astro
   - credentials/issue/index.astro
   - verification/index.astro
   - users/index.astro

2. **Update Navigation Components**
   - SideBar.astro (use useFeatureNavigation hook)
   - NavBarSidebar.astro
   - Any dropdown menus

3. **Test Role-Based Access**
   - Platform admin access
   - Organization owner/admin
   - Member/issuer/verifier roles

### Medium Priority
4. **Update React Components**
   - Implement FeatureGate components
   - Use useCommonFeatures hooks
   - Replace manual permission checks

5. **Complete Page Migrations**
   - Remaining 18 Astro pages
   - All nested route pages

### Low Priority
6. **Clean Up Legacy Code**
   - Remove old FeatureRoutes arrays
   - Remove old check-session.ts
   - Update any remaining manual role checks

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Functional Testing
- [ ] Platform admin can access all routes
- [ ] Organization roles respect feature boundaries
- [ ] Unauthorized users get proper redirects
- [ ] Route patterns match correctly

### UI Testing
- [ ] FeatureGate components show/hide correctly
- [ ] Navigation menus respect permissions
- [ ] Platform admin indicator appears
- [ ] Loading states work properly

### Backend Alignment
- [ ] Frontend routes match backend API patterns
- [ ] Feature permissions align with API endpoints
- [ ] Organization context flows properly

## 📊 System Benefits

### Before (Dual System)
- Route arrays + Feature arrays
- Complex permission matrix
- Frontend-backend mismatch
- Maintenance overhead

### After (Feature-Based)
- Single feature-based system
- Pattern-based route mapping
- Aligned with backend APIs
- Simplified maintenance

## 🔍 Key Architecture Decisions

1. **Pattern-Based Mapping**: Uses RegExp patterns like `/^\/organizations\/schemas/` → `Features.VIEW_SCHEMAS`
2. **Platform Admin Priority**: Platform admins get `Object.values(Features)` automatically
3. **Cumulative Roles**: Organization roles build upon each other (admin includes issuer features)
4. **Backend Alignment**: Frontend patterns match `/orgs/{orgId}/{feature}` API structure
5. **React Integration**: Hooks and components for declarative UI control

## 🚀 Deployment Readiness

- ✅ Build passes successfully
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Core functionality preserved
- ✅ Migration path documented
- ⏳ Gradual rollout in progress

The foundation is solid and ready for continued migration of remaining pages.
